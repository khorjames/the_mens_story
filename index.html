          <p>The fashion industry is the worldâ€™s second largest contributor to pollution.</p>
          <p>Sustainable fashion aims to create a perfect balance in the design, manufacture and use of clothes that ensures a clean environment, regenerates cultivation in the most natural manner, uplifts healthy and fair wage livelihoods, and finally when discarded, it biodegrades beautifully into mother nature easily.</p>
          <p>At The Men's Story, we believe in doing our part to protect our delicate environment by using organic cotton bio-degradable dye in producing our clothes, using eco-friendly packaging to pack the clothes, and lastly by investing in sustainable production methods and innovations to design and manufacture environmental-friendly and sustainable clothings as well as for recyling.</p>

          <br>
          <p>At the Men's Story, it is about embracing comfort, indivuality and style in what you wear.</p>
          <p>Comfort is King in Fashion and has been for a long time. According to a Google Trends data, searches for comfort wear increased by 1,300% from early March to mid April in 2020. At The Men's Story, we take pride of the comfortable fabris in our clothing. For example, we use 100% organic cotton as it is a soft, natural, and breathable fibre.</p>
          <p>Style refers to a person's particular way of expressing themselves through clothing. It is also an expression of individuality through aesthetic choices such as clothing, accessories and shoewear. At The Men's Story, we move away from trends but we help every individual to find their personal style with our fashions.
          <p>We invite you to The Men's Story to experiment fashion in both comfort and style. Discover your individuality. Create your own style. Experience unparalleled comfort.</p>
